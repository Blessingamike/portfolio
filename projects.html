                <h3>Word Guessing Game</h3>
                <p>The game presents the user with two words to guess their connection within five attempts. Each wrong guess reveals two additional hint words but reduces the score. The game ends when the user guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts, displaying their final score. Additionally, users can create custom mini-games by saving word connections and answers in a file via file I/O, which can later be used to play.</p>

                <h3>Remote-Control Drone for Disaster Relief</h3>
                <p>In this team project, we chose a drone as our device for disaster relief, specifically for surveying affected areas and delivering supplies. My role involved analyzing the drone’s feasibility and its potential for use in rescue missions. We worked together to define the user requirements, system specifications, and consider ethical challenges. This experience allowed me to collaborate with my team to explore the technical challenges of autonomous delivery and data processing, showcasing my ability to analyze complex technologies and work effectively in a team setting.</p>

                <h3>Website for Catering Company</h3>
                <p>I am currently working on a website for my mum’s catering business using HTML and CSS. The project involves building the foundational structure and styling, with a focus on creating an appealing and user-friendly interface. Once the basic design is complete, I will integrate JavaScript and Java to enhance the site’s interactivity, adding features such as payment ordering and user reviews. This project allows me to apply my web development skills while contributing to a real-world business.</p>
